<h2>Project Unnati Digital Day</h2>
<p align="justify">Aaina Foundation with Enactus Dtu organised the first DIGITAL DAY event in Shahbad Dairy Slum on 17th September. 
A one of its kind event, Digital Day saw a wonderful turnout of bubbly and enthusiastic children. A wide range of activities were conducted like typing test, painting contest on PC, cheque filling, photo quiz etc and prizes were given to the winners. Adults were guided by our volunteers on the various process of banking & were introduced to e-wallets like PayTM & BhimApp. We also tried to sensitize them about the various digital programmes run by the Government for self-learning and self-employment. 
The attendees were addressed, where they were informed about our flagship venture 'UNNATI CAFE' and its related services. 
The massive success of the event makes us very proud and even more optimistic about the future of Project Unnati.
