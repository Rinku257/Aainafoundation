<h2>Health For All</h2>
<p align="justify"> Social health and cognitive health are equally important for a person's overall well-being. A person can maintain their social health when they communicate effectively with others. Also, when a person is friendly to us and goes to social ceremonies, his social health will definitely be good. Similarly, our cognitive health refers to performing mental processes effectively. To do that well, one should always eat healthy.</p>
