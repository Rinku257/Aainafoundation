Due to not being a cleanliness in our country - the first reason for not being thought of our country, you are more because we are dread and garbage man is disagreed by the race. You and we throw a lot of garbage and spread every dirty everybody, we are not going to clean up and clean, our main reason is that there are many reasons why the main reason is to be told here. Although the lands are very backward in the field of education, our country has been very rewarding in the field of education, but still the revolution of education is done. But if people are not educated home, then they will not know that they are polluted by the unlimited environment. The reason for the policy of clean and clean. India is a bad reason. The problem of such a mentality is that the bad menty of our country is the bad mind of people. The people of such a mentality that the person with such a mentality, the people who are so little garbage, then the people of such a trash becomes a little garbage that the lack of our country is more than the dirt, the people of such a garbage becomes a little garbage, because of this mind, the little people becomes a little garbage and the roads of this country becomes a little garbage, the lack of garbage everywhere and the roads of our country becomes a little garbage, the people who make their land of the country.
To keep the country of India clean and tidy, we will have to start with ourselves today, as it is impossible to have cleanliness in our country till people themselves become aware. Therefore, we will have to keep our street as well as our streets clean by ourselves and there will not be any kind of dirt that will be garbage, always put it in the garbage vessel.
We have to build toilets in every house of the country.
Public toilets will have to be built at public places in every city and every village.
Awareness of cleanliness and hygiene has to be spread among the people.
We have to create garbage characters everywhere.
Promotion of education will have to be encouraged.
To change the mindset of the people, the message of cleanliness has to be sent to the villages.
People have to tell about the serious consequences of filth so that they know how much damage is caused to them as well as the whole environment by spreading their filth.
We must reduce the growing population.
We have to find out the right method of disposal of waste and implement it as if heaps of garbage like mountains can be removed.
We have to spread awareness among the people running the industry how polluted our entire environment is due to their small selfishness.
