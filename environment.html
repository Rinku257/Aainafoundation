<h2><u>Environment</u></h2>
<p align="justify" style="padding: 20px;"> Whatever is the physical, biological and cultural environment, there is a very environment. The beginning of life is continuous contact with configurations, we struggle and harmon with our environment by the beginning of the end. A person is the environment for the other person, so the environment is to see us in the right harmony and the same as the protection of the socialism, but the only health of the society is the same but the protection is used. The other is to be with the environment, the other is to be with the environment. The human being in the name of development, the form of the form of the nature in the form of the formation of the nature, and the way the person is thrilled in the surroundings of the surroundings, so much balance is the worse than the person's environment and continuously deteriorating that he is going to be deadline. The pollution is continuously more about the development of all the people and the public for the public of all people and countries.

The main reasons are - continuously increasing clusters, smoke emitted by vehicles, falling litter in rivers, ponds, deforestation, increased use of chemical fertilizers, floods, soil erosion and ever-increasing population. Till now the problem of environmental pollution was limited to a few cities, but now villages are also falling prey to it.

Everyone has to be environmentally aware. Environment is the most important priority of our life. The primary question is to control the use of nuclear energy as an energy source in developed countries. We can keep the environment clean by searching for non-conventional sources of energy, especially by finding sources that reduce environmental pollution greatly. The need is that everyone should stop harming it by harmonizing with nature to fulfill vested interests.
